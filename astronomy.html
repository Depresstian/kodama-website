<b><a href="https://youtu.be/XUbG8jboh4M">Stargazing Basics Part 1 - Terminology</a></b> <br>
NSEW applies for stars close to the horizon <br>
Stars, like the sun, rise in the east and set in the west <br>
Meridian: N-S Vertical Line <br>
Zenith: Halfway mark on the meridian, direct overhead <br>
Ecliptic: The path of the sun, often a guide for movement of the planets <br>
Polaris: The north star, above the north pole on the planet's rotational axis. Stars appear to rotate around it <br>
&emsp; As you approach the equator, polaris approaches the horizon but remains towards North <br>
Celestial Sphere: Mapping coordinates onto a projected sphere. <br>
&emsp; Right ascension: Facing north, the path of the sun rising in the east, or the right. Pillar from which distance is measured in degrees <br>
&emsp; Declination: Degrees away from the celestial poles, vertically. Measured in degress from 0 to 90 <br>
<br>

<b><a href="https://youtu.be/9P8Veb_AlJ0">Stargazing Basics Part 2 - Measuring brightness</a></b> <br>
Star magnitude scale is logarithmic, and can be used to extrapolate brightness of other celestial bodies. <br>
Lower magnitudes indicate more brightness, with the moon and the sun taking the most negative values <br>
Higher magnitudes indicate less brightness, making them harder to identify <br>
Absolute Magnitude: Brightness of different bodies at a fixed distance (10 parsecs), from earth. used less often <br>
<br>

<b><a href="https://youtu.be/YMu5k3Ik7JU">Stargazing Basics Part 3 - Measuring distance</a></b> <br>
Along the meridian, we measure the sky as 180 degrees across. <br>
Horizon-Zenith = 90 degrees <br>
Hand trick = Approximately <br>
&ensp; Oustretched thumb and pinky = 25 degrees of sky <br>
&ensp; Oustretched index and pinky = 15 degrees of sky <br>
&ensp; Fist = 10 degrees of sky <br>
&ensp; Middle3 fingers = 5 degrees of sky <br>
&ensp; Pinky = 1 degrees of sky <br>
<br>

<b><a href="https://youtu.be/TQNH_0lMqF0">Types of constellations</a></b> <br>
1. Circumpolar Constellations - Constellations that never disappear below horizon and can be seen all year round <br>
&emsp; Ursa Major <br>
&emsp; Ursa Minor - Handle Star = Polaris <br>
&emsp; Draco the Dragon - Sandwiched between ursas major & minor <br>
&emsp; Cassiopea - W/M shape <br>
&emsp; Cepheus - The King <br>
 
2. Zodiacal Constellations - Constellations in which the sun passes through <br>
&emsp; The 12 Zodiacs -  Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. <br>

3. Seasonal Constellations - Constellations that appear during particular seasons <br>

<b><a href="https://youtu.be/XUbG8jboh4M">Stargazing Basics Part 1 - Terminology</a></b> <br>
NSEW applies for stars close to the horizon <br>
Stars, like the sun, rise in the east and set in the west <br>
Meridian: N-S Vertical Line <br>
Zenith: Halfway mark on the meridian, direct overhead <br>
Ecliptic: The path of the sun, often a guide for movement of the planets <br>
Polaris: The north star, above the north pole on the planet's rotational axis. Stars appear to rotate around it <br>
&emsp; As you approach the equator, polaris approaches the horizon but remains towards North <br>
Celestial Sphere: Mapping coordinates onto a projected sphere. <br>
&emsp; Right ascension: Facing north, the path of the sun rising in the east, or the right. Pillar from which distance is measured in degrees <br>
&emsp; Declination: Degrees away from the celestial poles, vertically. Measured in degress from 0 to 90 <br>
<br>

<b><a href="https://youtu.be/9P8Veb_AlJ0">Stargazing Basics Part 2 - Measuring brightness</a></b> <br>
Star magnitude scale is logarithmic, and can be used to extrapolate brightness of other celestial bodies. <br>
Lower magnitudes indicate more brightness, with the moon and the sun taking the most negative values <br>
Higher magnitudes indicate less brightness, making them harder to identify <br>
Absolute Magnitude: Brightness of different bodies at a fixed distance (10 parsecs), from earth. used less often <br>
<br>

<b><a href="https://youtu.be/YMu5k3Ik7JU">Stargazing Basics Part 3 - Measuring distance</a></b> <br>
Along the meridian, we measure the sky as 180 degrees across. <br>
Horizon-Zenith = 90 degrees <br>
Hand trick = Approximately <br>
&ensp; Oustretched thumb and pinky = 25 degrees of sky <br>
&ensp; Oustretched index and pinky = 15 degrees of sky <br>
&ensp; Fist = 10 degrees of sky <br>
&ensp; Middle3 fingers = 5 degrees of sky <br>
&ensp; Pinky = 1 degrees of sky <br>

<h2>Astrology - A History of Western Astrology Volume 1</h2>
<b>Intro/Definitions</b> <br>
>two types of astrology: specific intending to divine specific events, and broad or nonspecific <br>
<br>
<b>Chapter 1</b> <br>
>Astrology is marked by the search for meaning in the sky, amongst the stars and planets and in the sun and moon." <br>
>The day and night cycle, along with the movements of the Sun and the Moon were important to early human life <br>
>Makes sense that they would be absorbed into story-telling to make sense of the world <br>
>Think more deeply about the effect that the removal of true night has had on how we liver <br>
>Very interesting that the cycle of the moon is almost regular at about every 28 days <br>
>Keeping track of the lunar cycle probably led to more *awareness* of time passing, could be a fun experiment nowadays <br>
>SMT mechanic of moon cycling is kinda cool with this in mind <br>
>"Or rather, we should say, human life was tied to the natural environment which
itself included the stars as much as plants, stones and animals. There was, it seems
a high regard for the powers of the sky, a celestial theology' in which human life
was tied to the heavens." <br>
>Transition from lunar tracking to stellar, where stars were next to be analysed (example: herald of day/night <br>
>The Pleiades, the bright star cluster visible to the naked eye, has myths all across the globe) <br>
<br>
<b>Chapter 2</b> <br>
>Two forms of cosmology, shamanistic and geomantic

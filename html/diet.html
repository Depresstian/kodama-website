<h3>Freezing to avoid having food go bad - Use reusable glass freezer containaers</h3>
><b>Freezing Meat <a href="https://youtu.be/YQc4vxdHmpY">Link</a>: </b> [Thin cut chicken; Sausage Mix <a href="../images/Recipes/northern-thai-sausage.png"> Thai</a>; Portion Sized Meat; Stir Fry] <br>
><b>Freezing Vegetables <a href="https://youtu.be/XlndcLo3j7I">Link</a> </b> Stir fry filler; Meal Side <br>
>I'd like to continue expanding my knowledge of freezing techniques, get to the point where an antiquity man would be jealous of me <br>



<br><br>
<b>Strategy:</b> Two reasons to freeze items. <br>
1 Backup ingredients that don't need monitoring until they are needed, <br>
2. Uncommon items: ex. Pizza ingredients; <br>
3. Pre-prep meals: Dumplings, frozen meal of some kind <br>
&thinsp;>Other additions: Butter, Juice, Stock cube tray <br>

<br>
>Categories of [1]: Protein, Veggie, Bread. <br>
&thinsp;>Breads are easy, rice and potatoes are stored even w/o freezer. Primary use: Storing baguettes that will be consumed after delay, maybe buns <br>
&thinsp;>Protein source for when fridge protein is run out, and groceries are not yet done. Must be cycled within 3 months <br>
&thinsp;&thinsp;>Chicken Thights, Sausage, Some cut of steak <br>
&thinsp;>Veggie: Most multivariable. Meal Side or addition. Broccoli, Green beans, Asparagus, Corn, Peas, Onion, Pepper, Ginger  <br>
&thinsp;&thinsp;>Container 1: Onion/Pepper stir fry mix; <br> &thinsp;&thinsp;>Bagged: Corn, Peas. <br> &thinsp;&thinsp;>Maybe container 2: Broccoli, Asparagus, Cauliflower <br>

<br>
>[2]Pint jar pizza dough


<h2>Fermentation Recipe - <a href="https://youtu.be/ZghX4Mrg7kw">Video</a> I've found helpful</h2>
>1.Calculate the total weight of water + food <br>
>2.Total weigtht * 0.025g = Grams of salt required <br>
>3.Transfer liquid to new jar, add salt til weight reached <br>
>4.Return to veggies, seal and store. <br>


<h2>Pickling Recipe - <a href="https://youtu.be/K4HbmPu_M_4">Red Onion</a> </h2>
>Bring equal parts water and 5% vinegar to a boil <br>
>Add between 1-2tsp (or a "nice pinch") of pickling salt per cup of water-vinegar mix <br>
>Boil, and add to jars filled with with cut veggies & optional aromatics. <br>
>Make sure your jars won't shatter from the heat. Store in fridge <br>

<h2>How to turn herbs into spices</h2>
>Slice ingredients thinly <br>
>Dehydrate for appropriate time <br>
&emsp; Herbs: 115f for 5-10 hours
&emsp; Chili/Pepper Powder: 130f til cracker dry
&emsp; Garlic & Onion: 130f for 8-12 hours
>Blend result <br>

<h1>Nutritional Planning </h1>
2024-06-20
>Protein Intake: 0.8g/kg to 1.8kg/kg of body weight. Some sources suggest someone highly active consumes from 1.8 to 2 g/kg of body weight <br>
>My ratio of choice shall be 1.2g/kg for now, free to adjust as desired. Mainly considering limiting meat consumption, while having enough energy to exercise <br>
>160lbs => 72.5kg * 1.2g/kg = 87g of protein per day. Division: 30/30/20 <br>
>The tricky part is this, how much protein is in what you're eating? A tool <a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/">https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/</a> <br>
&thinsp;Meat rests between 18~20g of protein per 100g. Meaning 87gs of protein intake a day requires 480 grams of meat. <br>
&thinsp;Non-meat supplements: 6g per egg; Beans: ; Lentils: ; could try tofu <br>

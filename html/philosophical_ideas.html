	<h1>Major Philosophical Schools & Authors</h1> <br>
	<p>By philosophy, I mean the study of ideas engaged with in the world in order to act on them in a logically consistent manner. <br>
		
		Why am I interested in philosophy? Generally, making wise decisions involves having the pre-requisite knowledge of the situation at hand. 
		I think this serves as a good metaphor for the use of philosophy in daily living. There are fundamental assumptions about the working of the world, 
		held by all, but philosophy puts those ideas to the test of critical analysis, so that the way in which we live can be justified and directed to
		better/intended outcomes.

	</p>
	<p>What's my approach in dividing these? Generally, philosophical schools have presented ideas in works of varying size all across the globe.
		In exploring these traditions, there are some methodologies that could be followed. <br>
		-Select a variety of traditions, though they will have to be written moreso  <br>
		-Analyze them one at a time (one text or one idea), to try not to spread research too thin. Do I have the attention span to commit myself to a single work? <br>
		-Strategy for choosing works?  <br>
		&emsp;-Following schools in a progressive chronological/logical order; west(greek/arabic/enlightenment) vs east(india/china) <br>
		&emsp;-Jumping between schools, selecting the most important works <br>

		<br><br>
		Ultimately it is up to me to design something like a curriculum, and even harder, to stick with it. Looking at Dr. K's stuff(honestly noting alot of it down),
		to figure out what kind of learning is compatible with me. <br>
		<br> I'm starting with eastern philosophy cause it's cooler, but swap to plato/aristotle as I crave it. Acknowledge it'll be tougher as I've kinda covered India before

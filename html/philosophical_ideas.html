	<h1>Major Philosophical Schools & Authors</h1> <br>
	<p>By philosophy, I mean the study of ideas engaged with in the world in order to act on them in a logically consistent manner. <br>
		
		Why am I interested in philosophy? Generally, making wise decisions involves having the pre-requisite knowledge of the situation at hand. 
		I think this serves as a good metaphor for the use of philosophy in daily living. There are fundamental assumptions about the working of the world, 
		held by all, but philosophy puts those ideas to the test of critical analysis, so that the way in which we live can be justified and directed to
		better/intended outcomes.

	</p>
	<p>What's my approach in dividing these? Generally, philosophical schools have presented ideas in works of varying size all across the globe.
		In exploring these traditions, there are some methodologies that could be followed. <br>
		-Select a variety of traditions, though they will have to be written moreso  <br>
		-Analyze them one at a time (one text or one idea), to try not to spread research too thin. Do I have the attention span to commit myself to a single work? <br>
		-Strategy for choosing works?  <br>
		&emsp;-Following schools in a progressive chronological/logical order; west(greek/arabic/enlightenment) vs east(india/china) <br>
		&emsp;-Jumping between schools, selecting the most important works <br>

		<br><br>
		Ultimately it is up to me to design something like a curriculum, and even harder, to stick with it. Looking at Dr. K's stuff(honestly noting alot of it down),
		to figure out what kind of learning is compatible with me. <br>
		<br> I'm starting with eastern philosophy cause it's cooler, but swap to plato/aristotle as I crave it. Acknowledge it'll be tougher as I've kinda covered India before

	<h1>Dr. K's Guide to Doin' Stuff</h1>
	<p><b>The Three-fold model of motivation:</b> <br>
		<b>>Intent: </b> Having intrinsic goals will lead to more success than those acquired extrinsically <br>
		<b>>Resistance: </b> Though we may intend, there can be some difficulty to address between intending and actually doing. <br>
		&thinsp;>Emotional <br>
		&thinsp;>Egotic - Ahamkara <br>
		<b>>Action: Following through on intent</b> <br>
	</p>

	<p><b>Origin of Thoughts</b> <br>
		1>Reflex/Instinct - Automatic and happend without intention <br>
		2>Habit - Trained action that becomes automatic <br>
		3>Thought - Actions originate from thoughts <br> 
		&thinsp;>If we want to control our actions, strengthening the mind to create the right kinds of action generating thoughts is a more foundational angle. <br>
	</p>

	<p><b>Origin of Motivation</b> <br>
		>What is motivation? Motivation != Desire; Motivation != Habit, though it helps; <br>
		>Motivation is the ability to hold one thought persistently in the mind. The <b>One-Pointed Mind</b>, if a goal is held for a long time it will lead behavior in that direction naturally  <br>
		>Dharana, focusing technique for training the one-pointed mind. 
	</p>

	<p><b>How to Concentrate</b> <br>
		>There are three fundamentals operations of the mind, that can be strengthened with dedicated meditative practices <br>
		&thinsp;><b>The ability to direct the mind</b>: Directing thought meditation (selecting various objects to direct attention, shift when thoughts begin to drift) <br>
		&thinsp;><b>The ability to let go of a thought in the mind:</b> Pratyahara(sensory withdrawal) <br>
		&thinsp;><b>The ability to hold a thought in the mind:</b>  Dharana<br>
		+Awareness of thought meditation <br>
	</p>

	<p><b>Indriyas</b> <br>
		How does thought come about? A major answer is the Indriyas, <b>sensory impressions</b> <br>
		A sensory impression gets attached to an <b>emotional reaction</b> and gets laid down, becoming a "thought creating machine", or samskara <br>
		Digesting that samskara can help alter thinking by removing unwanted thought generators, and we can also implant good thought generators <br>
		For completeness, also consider transcendental thought, or some intriguing thought tied to the self without any sensory or emotional origin. <br>
	</p>

	<p><b>Pratyahara</b> <br>
		>The more attention is devoted to one sensory organ, the more powerful it becomes. Removing organs increase the ability of the remainder <br>
		>Light metaphor for attention: lightbulb; flashlight; laser beam. The narrower our focus, the stronger our output <br>
		>Pratyahara is a technique which specifically increases our attentive capabilities; control the mind through control of the sensory organs <br>
		>When solving boredom with entertainement, we rely on external sources to pull our attention to something, rather than relying on ourselves to direct our attention. In time, we lose this ability to direct our attention, and so meditative training is one answer to strengthening this. <br>
	</p>

	<p><b>Cognitive Drains</b> <br>
		>The more things you deem of importance and carry mentally, the more drain is <br>
		>For each mental attachement to an idea/task/resolve/whatever, there is some mental component there being taken up leading to less available energy. <br>
		>This could also be considered karmic <br>
		>Two solutions: Satisfaction or grief <br>

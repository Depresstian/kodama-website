We all understand why exercise is important logically, it's just about doing it enough that your body gets accustomed to it <br>
Maybe this is my bias, but I think exercise is universally fun, you just need to find what kind of exercise YOU find enjoyeable or rewarding <br>


<br>
<b>Compound Training vs Isolation Training</b> <br>
>There is a foundational difference in the target of exercises that changes how they should be implemented <br>
>Compound exercises feature more movement and engage are larger set of muscles, typically a muscle group <br>
>Isolation exercises focus on engaging a specific set of muscles for greater effect <br>
>I prefer compound exercises which ensure a more balanced gain of strength<br>


<h2>Coming up with a workout plan</h2>
>I like to divide the body's muscles into 6 groups, any smaller planning-wise is too specific imo <br>
>1.Arms - Triceps & Biceps <br>
>2.Core <br>
>3.Shoulders <br>
>4.Chest <br>
>5.Back <br>
>6.Legs <br>
<br>
><b>How to split these?</b> <br>
>How many musclegroups do you want to hit in a single workout? <br>
>How much rest do you need? <br>



<br>
<h1>Kettlebells</h2>
I like kettlebells for a few reasons. <br>
>1. First, kettlebell exercises normally engage whole muscle groups and suit my preference for compound training. <br>
>2. Second, they're a single isolated piece of equipment that isn't really a hassle to store but can give a great workout <br>
>3. Finally, I had access to it. The kettlebell swing was one of my first workout breakthroughs only because I had one available. 
	As such, I've come to see it as the old relaible option. <br>

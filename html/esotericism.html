	<h2>Wester Esotericism: A Guide for the perplexed</h2>
	<b>Chapter 1</b><br>
	>Influential Models for the Study of Esotericism <br>
	>1.Early modern enchantment, manifestation of romanticism <br>
	>2.As a contemporary element of (post)modernity <br>
	&emsp; "When sociologists first began studying the
	occult during the 1960s and 1970s, they saw it as a surprising
	and somehow disconcerting phenomenon of social ‘deviance’
	concerned with ‘anomalous’ claims of knowledge that seemed to
	reflect a movement of youthful rebellion against science and estab-
	lished religion.10 They had trouble seeing anything else in it than a
	heartfelt but obviously futile reaction against rationalization and
	the forward march of modernity. In more recent years, however,
	sociologists and historians of religion have begun to see the occult
	as a significant manifestation of modernity.11 Predictions about the
	imminent demise of religion have turned out to be premature, to
	say the least; and it has become ever more evident that esoteric or
	occult currents are a permanent feature of modern culture." <br><br>

	&emsp; "In current scholar-ship, the occult is therefore no longer 
	perceived as a marginal and irritating anomaly – something that 
	‘should not be there’ – but, on the contrary, as a highly 
	important manifestation of how religion is continuously being 
	reinvented under new historical and social con-ditions." <br><br>

	>3.Inner Traditions, represent some shared inner truth about the world <br>
	&emsp; Problems: Scientifically unverifiable, science is necessarily exoteric <br><br>

	>Books theme:
	&emsp;  In sum
	in the rest of this book we will be studying a large and complicated
	field of research that (1) has been set apart by mainstream religious
	WESTERN ESOTERICISM: A GUIDE FOR THE PERPLEXED14
	and intellectual culture as the ‘other’ by which it defines its own
	identity, and (2) is characterized by a strong emphasis on specific
	worldviews and epistemologies that are at odds with normative
	post-Enlightenment intellectual culture.

<h2>Astrology - A History of Western Astrology Volume 1</h2>
<b>Intro/Definitions</b> <br>
>two types of astrology: specific intending to divine specific events, and broad or nonspecific <br>
<br>
<b>Chapter 1</b> <br>
>Astrology is marked by the search for meaning in the sky, amongst the stars and planets and in the sun and moon." <br>
>The day and night cycle, along with the movements of the Sun and the Moon were important to early human life <br>
>Makes sense that they would be absorbed into story-telling to make sense of the world <br>
>Think more deeply about the effect that the removal of true night has had on how we liver <br>
>Very interesting that the cycle of the moon is almost regular at about every 28 days <br>
>Keeping track of the lunar cycle probably led to more *awareness* of time passing, could be a fun experiment nowadays <br>
>SMT mechanic of moon cycling is kinda cool with this in mind <br>
>"Or rather, we should say, human life was tied to the natural environment which
itself included the stars as much as plants, stones and animals. There was, it seems
a high regard for the powers of the sky, a celestial theology' in which human life
was tied to the heavens." <br>
>Transition from lunar tracking to stellar, where stars were next to be analysed (example: herald of day/night <br>
>The Pleiades, the bright star cluster visible to the naked eye, has myths all across the globe) <br>
